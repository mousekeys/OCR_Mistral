       "\"# 1. Best Self-Hostable Tools for Character Consistency \\n\\nStable Diffusion (SD) - Stability AI's Stable Diffusion is the leading open-source image generation model for self-hosting. Unlike closed services (MidJourney, DALL-E) which lack fine-tuning, Stable Diffusion's open models can be run on your own GPU server and customized to learn a specific character 1 . The community around SD has created many free tools and methods for character control and consistency 1 . You can choose from SD model versions (v1.5, v2.1 or the newer SDXL for higher quality) - all are self-hostable.\\n\\nLocal Deployment and UIs: To run SD on your server, popular interfaces include AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI and ComfyUI. AUTOMATIC1111's web UI (available on GitHub) is user-friendly and supports extensions for training and ControlNet. It allows you to load models, generate images, and train embeddings/LoRAs through a browser. ComfyUI is a node-based interface for advanced workflows. Both are open-source and can be installed on a server with an NVIDIA GPU. Basic requirements are a GPU with at least $\\\\sim 6-8$ GB VRAM for standard SD (more for training large models or high-res images). (For example, SDXL models demand $\\\\sim 12$ GB VRAM to train or use.) Ensure you have the SD model weights (download from HuggingFace or official sources) and that your environment has PyTorch installed.\""
