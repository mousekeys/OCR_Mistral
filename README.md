To use the PDF OCR Processor, just follow these simple steps:

-----

## Usage 

To run the script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and execute the following command:

```bash
python your_script_name.py --pdf_path "/path/to/your/pdf/document.pdf"
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script (e.g., `ocr_processor.py`) and `/path/to/your/pdf/document.pdf` with the **absolute path** to your PDF file.

### Example:

If your script is named `ocr_processor.py` and your PDF is located at `/home/user/documents/report.pdf`, you would run:

```bash
python ocr_processor.py --pdf_path "/home/user/documents/report.pdf"
```
